Code to use the 16-bit S-D ADC on an MSP430 f2013 read the attached load cell
and send the values out on the serial port at P1.1.

On the Launchpad dev board, p1.1 is bridged to USB by default. After attaching
the launchpad by USB, run

$ mspdebug rf2500 exit

use dmesg to get the serial device:

$ dmesg | tail -n10
-- snip --
[15502.783490] cdc_acm 3-1:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
-- snip --

configure the device:
$ stty 2400 -F /dev/ttyACM0

then it's ready for reading:

$ cat /dev/ttyACM0

These steps need to be automated, or possibly the system should be switched to i2c so they're not necessary.  For testing put them all on one line:

$ mspdebug rf2500 exit; stty 2400 -F /dev/ttyACM0; cat /dev/ttyACM0
